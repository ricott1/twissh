## Radio

ssh <user>@<host> "wget <stream> -O -" | mplayer -cache 512 -

ssh r1.scenesat.com "wget album/the-sound-of-scenesat-volume-5 -O -" | mplayer -cache 512 -

https://music.scenesat.com/album/the-sound-of-scenesat-volume-5
The subtleties:

wget's -O (capital letter oh) option sets its output file; - (dash) implies stdout.

mplayer's -cache option causes a configurable amount of input to be buffered, compensating for network jitter. The - (dash) option makes it read from stdin.

Try streaming SceneSat Radio, for example. http://r1.scenesat.com:8000/scenesat
